# queue_with_stacks

we create queue wih two stacks


Queue: is a built-in data structure to store items.
has two types to store items inside it:
FIFO: first in first out means the first item into the stack will pop from it the first one.
LILO: last in last out means the last item into the stack will pop from it the last one.
enqueue: push or append the item to the rear of the queue.
dequeue: pop or remove the item from the front of the queue.


Big o for enqueue and dequeue, the worst case scenario is O(1)
