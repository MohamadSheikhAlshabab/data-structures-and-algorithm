How to impelment the graph.

## Challenge

A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges. The various terms and functionalities associated with a graph is described in great detail in our tutorial here. In this chapter we are going to see how to create a graph and add various data elements to it using a python program. Following are the basic operations we perform on graphs.

    - Display graph vertices
    - Display graph edges
    - Add a vertex
    - Add an edge
    - Creating a graph

## Approach & Efficiency

Worst case scenario:
- Time compexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
